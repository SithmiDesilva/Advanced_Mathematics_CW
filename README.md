# Advanced Mathematics - Coursework 01

 ## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is part of the coursework for the CM2607 Advanced Mathematics module. It addresses mathematical problems and their computational solutions, leveraging Python's capabilities for numerical and symbolic computation. The notebook is structured to integrate explanations, derivations, and Python implementations for solving mathematical tasks.

 ## Notebook Structure
The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. Introduction:
   -Contains title and author information.
   - Provides context for the coursework.

3. Problem Statements:
   - Clearly delineates each question or task using markdown cells.
   - Includes visual aids like equations and images for better understanding.

4. Code Implementation:
   - Utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SymPy.
   - Includes functions and scripts to solve the problems step-by-step.
   - Demonstrates computational techniques for tasks like finding gradients and solving equations.

5. Results and Visualization:
   - Outputs of calculations are displayed directly below code cells.
   - Visualizations (if any) are created using Matplotlib.

## Requirements
To execute the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sympy as sp
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
from scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq
from scipy.fftpack import fft2, ifft2, fftshift
import cv2

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or any compatible environment.
2. Execute the cells in order to ensure dependencies are loaded before running computations.
3. Modify the code if needed for exploration or deeper analysis.

## Purpose
This notebook serves both as a learning tool and as an assessment submission. It demonstrates:
- Mathematical problem-solving skills.
- Proficiency in Python for numerical and symbolic computation.
- Ability to communicate solutions effectively through well-documented code and markdown explanations.

## Notes
- The notebook includes references to coursework-specific images and equations. Ensure these resources are available and correctly linked for a seamless experience.
- Outputs are cleared by default; rerun the notebook to generate results.
